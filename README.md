# EV Charging Optimization with Machine Learning and Reinforcement Learning

This project implements **intelligent charging strategies for Electric Vehicles (EVs)** by combining **electricity price forecasting** with **Markov Decision Process (MDP)** and **Q-learning**.  
The system demonstrates how agent-based optimization can minimize EV charging cost under dynamic electricity prices.

## üöÄ How to Run

### 1. Price Prediction Only
```bash
python XGBoost.py
python random\ forest.py
python DNN(MDP).py
Outputs:

Regression metrics: MSE, R¬≤, MAPE

Figures:

Actual vs Predicted scatter plot

Price prediction trends over time

### 2. Full Optimization (Price Prediction + MDP/Q-learning)

python XGBoost(MDP).py
python DNN_model.py
---
Outputs:

Q-learning vs Fixed Strategy comparison

Total charging cost curves (per initial SoC)

Price Gain(%) vs Episode plots

Simulation logs (optional)

üìà Example Results
Price Forecasting (XGBoost/DNN/RF)

R¬≤ typically between 0.85‚Äì0.95 depending on features

Optimization Results

Q-learning agent converges to policies that reduce total charging cost

Up to 20‚Äì40% Price Gain compared to the fixed charging strategy

‚öôÔ∏è Dependencies
Python 3.8+

Required packages:

pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn xgboost tensorflow
üîÆ Future Improvements
Generalize predictor module to support plug-and-play (XGBoost / RF / DNN / others).

Replace hardcoded paths with argparse or YAML config.

Add multi-station, queueing, and power-capacity constraints.

Improve reproducibility: random seed control, unified logging, and saved models.
